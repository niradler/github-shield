# Proxy Shield for GitHub Server

## Overview
In today’s interconnected software ecosystem, protecting self-hosted infrastructure is more critical than ever. Proxy Shield provides a layer of security for self-hosted GitHub Enterprise servers by placing a secure, inspectable, and configurable proxy in front of vendor access. This ensures that no external access bypasses your organization’s security policies, giving you control over what happens within your environment.

## Use Case
Many organizations allow vendors or external partners to access their self-hosted GitHub servers for troubleshooting, support, or integration purposes. However, this introduces several risks:

1. **Blind Trust in Vendor Access**: Vendors often require direct access to sensitive resources without giving organizations visibility into what they are doing.
2. **Exposure to Supply Chain Attacks**: A compromised vendor could become an entry point for attackers to breach your infrastructure.
3. **Lack of Control**: Without a mechanism to monitor and enforce strict policies, organizations risk unintentional exposure of sensitive repositories or data.

**Proxy Shield** solves these issues by acting as an intermediary, ensuring all vendor access complies with your security policies, is logged, and can be monitored in real-time.

## Supply Chain Attacks: The Threat
Supply chain attacks have become one of the most significant threats to cybersecurity. Attackers often target trusted third-party vendors to infiltrate an organization’s systems. Examples include:

- Injecting malicious code into a vendor’s software update.
- Leveraging stolen vendor credentials to access customer environments.

A self-hosted GitHub server, which often contains sensitive intellectual property, source code, and credentials, is a high-value target. By implementing Proxy Shield, you mitigate the risk of such attacks by limiting vendor access to what is strictly necessary and adding a monitoring layer.

## How Proxy Shield Protects Your Server
Proxy Shield offers the following features to safeguard your GitHub server:

### 1. **Access Inspection and Monitoring**
- All requests made by vendors are inspected for compliance with security policies.
- Real-time monitoring ensures you have visibility into vendor actions.
- Logs are stored for audit and compliance purposes.

### 2. **Policy Enforcement**
- Define granular access policies to ensure vendors only access permitted endpoints.
- Automatically block or flag suspicious activity.
- Limit access to sensitive repositories or enforce read-only access where appropriate.

### 3. **Rate Limiting and Anomaly Detection**
- Protect against potential abuse or mistakes by enforcing rate limits.
- Detect unusual patterns, such as mass cloning of repositories or large data transfers.

### 4. **Authentication and Authorization**
- Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for vendor access.
- Integrate with your existing identity provider to ensure consistent user management.

### 5. **Vendor Isolation**
- Create isolated environments for different vendors to prevent cross-contamination or lateral movement.
- Use containerized proxies for each vendor session to further compartmentalize access.

## Deployment
Proxy Shield is lightweight and can be deployed in your existing infrastructure with minimal changes to your current setup. Here’s how it works:

1. **Setup**: Deploy the proxy server on a secure VM or container within your network.
2. **Configuration**: Define access rules, allowed endpoints, and authentication mechanisms.
3. **Routing**: Route all vendor traffic through Proxy Shield before it reaches your GitHub server.
4. **Monitoring**: Use the built-in dashboard or integrate with your SIEM for real-time monitoring and alerts.

## Key Benefits
- **Improved Visibility**: Know exactly what vendors are doing in your environment.
- **Stronger Security Posture**: Reduce the attack surface by implementing strict policies.
- **Compliance Assurance**: Maintain a complete audit trail of all vendor activities.
- **Peace of Mind**: Trust but verify—ensure vendors’ actions align with your organizational policies.

## Conclusion
Proxy Shield empowers security teams to regain control over their self-hosted GitHub servers without disrupting vendor workflows. By adding this critical layer of security, you protect your organization from supply chain attacks and ensure compliance with modern cybersecurity standards.

Secure your infrastructure today with Proxy Shield—because trusting vendors shouldn’t mean compromising your security.
